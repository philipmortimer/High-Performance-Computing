High perfomance code executed on Bristol University's supercomputer. The c program computes lattice boltzmann calculations. 
MPI and OpenMP are amongst the tools utilised to scale code performance across multiple threads and compute nodes to achieve rapid performance.
This work was completed as part of a University coursework and received a first class grade.
[Part 1](Part1) optimisies serial code using vectorisitaion and parallelisation with OpenMP. The [PDF report](Part1/report.pdf) explains what has occurred in detail.
[Part 2](Part2) builds on the work in part 1 and explores using MPI to deploy the code across multiple compute nodes. The [PDF report](Part2/report.pdf) explains what has occurred in detail.
